# Rotaries, my personal project
My first website, and programming project outside of my classes as a whole. Going to be hosted on Neocities. Focused on showing users information about the rotary (or wankel) engine and its history, especially pertaining the the Mazda RX-7 and RX-8 lines of vehicles.

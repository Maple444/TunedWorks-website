# TunedWorks, a hobby project
My first website and programming project outside of my classes as a whole. Hosted on neocities, and is just a hobby project. The site is focused on showing users information about famous JDM tuner cars and their history. 

Originally called Rotaries, but the focus of the site has now been broadened to tuner cars as a whole.

            <h1>Technology, As Art</h1>
            <p>Throughout history, we have seen multiple form factors of computers.</p>
            <p>
                Many computers have a functional design. This is exemplifed in many different computers. A Dell Optiplex, while not being
                focused on looks, is a famous example of a computer that can be easily repaired and turned into a wonderous machine. Perhaps
                this could be considered a work of art on its own?

                Rotary engines, also known as Wankel engines, are a unique type of internal combustion
                engine that Mazda employed in its iconic RX-7 series, including the famous RX-7 FC and 
                FD. Unlike conventional piston engines, rotary engines utilize a triangular rotor that 
                rotates within an oval-shaped combustion chamber. This design eliminates the need for 
                reciprocating pistons, resulting in a compact and lightweight powerplant with a high 
                power-to-weight ratio and a unique high pitched engine sound. The Mazda RX-7 FC, for 
                example, featured a rotary engine known as the 13B, which was a two-rotor design. 
                Rotary engines are known for their smooth and high-revving characteristics, as well as
                their ability to deliver high power output in a smaller package. They often produce a 
                distinctive and captivating engine note. However, rotary engines can be quite unreliable 
                and less fuel-efficient compared to piston engines. Despite their quirks, the rotary 
                engine's unique design provided the RX-7 with its distinct performance and handling 
                characteristics, making it an integral part of the car's identity and a defining 
                feature of the Mazda RX-7 series.
